            She had an in-person pay structure and customers would take
            advantage of this by receiving service and leaving without paying.

          <li>
            Her client’s appointments got lost in her email because she used a
            contact form that people would fill out which sent to her email.
          </li>
          <li>
            She had unclear service pricing, so she received a lot of calls from
            clients asking pricing details.

              Calendly. I showed her how it seamlessly integrated into her
              website, allowed her to add her brand colors and logo, and sent
              automatic reminders to her clients. It also worked with Stripe so
              she can accept a “Deposit” before her clients arrive to ensure
              they don’t leave without paying.

        <p>
          She did not want to create a new domain name due to branding reasons.
          She went back to the company that made her initial website and had
          them embed a booking calendar with individual bookings for each
          service like I did with Calendly. She even paid the $300 fee for them
          to reinstate it. So I worked for free for 5-weeks and another company
          got paid for my design. The Vercel app of my design is still
          available, but the Calendly integration is disabled.

        <ol>
          <li>Have client sign an NDA.</li>
          <li>
            Approach stakeholder meetings with a detailed plan and talking
            points.
          </li>
          <li>
            Communicate with the dev during the wireframe process, so you don’t
            create something they can’t or won’t code.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes your design will be compromised due to time constraints or
            miscommunication in development, so communicate frequently!
